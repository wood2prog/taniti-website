          </li>
          <li>
            Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is

          </li>
          <li>
            There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has many

          </li>
          <li>
            Violent crime is very rare in Taniti, but as tourism increases,
            there are more reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist
            attractions and restaurants will be closed on holidays, so visitors
            should plan accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses
            will also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency
            exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.
