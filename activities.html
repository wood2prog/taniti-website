        <h1>Entertainment</h1>
        <p>
          Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest,
          and visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do,
          including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing
          tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several
          pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a
          movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art
          galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be
          operational by next year. Many of these activities are in Merriton
          Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of
          Yellow Leaf Bay.
        </p>

        <h1>Sightseeing</h1>

          Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts
          native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle
          Yellow Leaf Bay.
